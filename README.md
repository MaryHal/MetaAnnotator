# MetaAnnotator

Long story short, on YouTube, it's difficult to add annotations to _other_ people's videos. I wanted to do something about that, so... voila, here's a really simple web application built on top of PHP, postgresql, and jquery to store some annotations and play 'em back later.

On a whim, I decided to hack this together as fast as I could, so I gave myself the time limit of *TWO HOURS* to complete a basic version of this -- be able to add annotations through a web page and play them back later.

## Architecture

DB (postgresql) <=> PHP web API <=> Web application
